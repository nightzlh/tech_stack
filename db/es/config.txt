Temporary directory settings




jvm setings
	By default, Elasticsearch automatically sizes JVM heap based on a node‚Äôs roles and total memory. 
	Automatic heap sizing requires the bundled JDK or, if using a custom JRE location, a Java 14 or later JRE.



JVM fatal error log setting

RPM andDebian packages 
	this directory is /var/log/elasticsearch.
On Linux and MacOS and Windows distributions, 
	the logs directory is located under the root of the Elasticsearch installation.
	If this path is not suitable for receiving logs, modify the -XX:ErrorFile=... entry in jvm.options.
