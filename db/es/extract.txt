By default, Elasticsearch indexes all data in every field and each indexed field has a dedicated, optimized data structure. 

Elasticsearch also has the ability to be schema-less, which means that documents can be indexed without explicitly specifying how to handle each of the different fields that might occur in a document.


Elasticsearch provides a simple, coherent REST API 
	managing your cluster and indexing and searching your data.	
	you can easily submit requests directly from the command line or through the Developer Console in Kibana
	
	
Search your data
	The Elasticsearch REST APIs support structured queries, full text queries, and complex queries that combine the two


node
	When you start an instance of Elasticsearch, you are starting a node. 
	An Elasticsearch cluster is a group of nodes that have the same cluster.name attribute.

shards
        Elasticsearch provides the ability to subdivide your index into multiple pieces called shards. When you create an index, you can simply define the number of shards that you want. Each shard is in itself a fully-functional and independent "index" that can be hosted on any node in the cluster.

replicas
         it is very useful and highly recommended to have a failover mechanism in case a shard/node somehow goes offline or disappears for whatever reason. To this end, Elasticsearch allows you to make one or more copies of your index’s shards into what are called replica shards, or replicas for short.


Discovery
	Discovery is the process where nodes find each other when the master is unknown, such as when a node has just started up or when the previous master has failed.
	Discovery is the process by which the cluster formation module finds other nodes with which to form a cluster.

	This process starts with a list of seed addresses from one or more seed hosts providers
seed hosts Providers
	two seed hosts providers: 
		a settings-based: 
			in elasticsearch.yml
				discovery.seed_hosts:
				   - 192.168.1.10:9300
				   - 192.168.1.11
				   - seeds.mydomain.com
			
		a file-based seed hosts provider.	
			in elasticsearch.yml
				discovery.seed_providers: file
		file at $ES_PATH_CONF/unicast_hosts.txt

unicast_host.txt example
	10.10.10.5
	10.10.10.6:9305
	10.10.10.5:10005
	# an IPv6 address
	[2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334]:9301		

	If the port number is not specified, Elasticsearch will implicitly use the first port in the port range given by transport.profiles.default.port, or by transport.port if transport.profiles.default.port is not set.


boot es
	To add a node to a cluster running on your local machine:
	Set up a new Elasticsearch instance.
Specify the name of the cluster with the cluster.name setting in elasticsearch.yml. For example, to add a node to the logging-prod cluster, add the line cluster.name: "logging-prod" to elasticsearch.yml.
Start Elasticsearch. The node automatically discovers and joins the specified cluster.
	

	To add a node to a cluster running on multiple machines
	you must also set discovery.seed_hosts so that the new node can discover the rest of its cluster.



ducument
	Each document is a collection of fields, which each have their own data type. 	
	
	document metadata fileds
		_index 	The index to which the document belongs
		_type 	The document's mapping type
		_id 	The document's ID
		_source	The original JSON representing the body of the document.
		_size 	The size of the _source field in bytes, provided by the mapper-size plugin.
		_field_names All fields in the document which contain non-null values.
		_ignored All fields in the document that have been ignored at index time because of ignore_malformed.	
		_routing A custom routing value which routes a document to a particular shard.	
	
mapping 
	Mapping is the process of defining how a document, and the fields it contains, are stored and indexed.
	When mapping your data, you create a mapping definition, which contains a list of fields that are pertinent to the document. A mapping definition also includes metadata fields, like the _source field, which customize how a document’s associated metadata is handled.


mapping - runtime fileds
	

field types
	Flattened filed:
		Given an object, the flattened mapping will parse out its leaf values and index them into one field as keywords. The object’s contents can then be searched through simple queries and aggregations.	

	Nested: The nested type is a specialised version of the object data type that allows arrays of objects to be indexed in a way that they can be queried independently of each other. 

template
	index template
		 While you can use component templates to construct index templates, they aren’t directly applied to a set of indices. Index templates can contain a collection of component templates, as well as directly specify settings, mappings, and aliases.	

	component template
		Component templates are reusable building blocks that configure mappings, settings, and aliases.

template precedence
	Composable templates > legacy templates
	explicit settings on created > index template and its component templates
	index template with the highest priority is used	


ingest pipelines
	Ingest pipelines let you perform common transformations on your data before indexing.


Search
	define runtime fields that exist only in a query

Query

	Boolean Query

	Compound queries

	Term-level queries

	Full text queries

	Geo

	spatial queries

Query rescorer

	The query rescorer executes a second query only on the Top-K results returned by the query and post_filter phases.	


Aggregation
	An aggregation summarizes your data as metrics, statistics, or other analytics.

	Bucket Aggregation
		Each bucket is associated with a criterion (depending on the aggregation type) which determines whether or not a document in the current context "falls" into it.		
		 can hold sub-aggregations.

	Metrics Aggregation
		The aggregations in this family compute metrics based on values extracted in one way or another from the documents that are being aggregated.	

	Pipline Aggregation
		Pipeline aggregations work on the outputs produced from other aggregations rather than from document sets, adding information to the output tree.

		Parent
			A family of pipeline aggregations that is provided with the output of its parent aggregation and is able to compute new buckets or new aggregations to add to existing buckets.
	
		Sibling
			Pipeline aggregations that are provided with the output of a sibling aggregation and are able to compute a new aggregation which will be at the same level as the sibling aggregation.
			Pipeline aggregations cannot have sub-aggregations




Query DSL
	Relevance scores
		By default, Elasticsearch sorts matching search results by relevance score, which measures how well each document matches a query.
	
	Query context
		query clause also calculates a relevance score in the _score metadata field.
		Query context is in effect whenever a query clause is passed to a query parameter, such as the query parameter in the search API.


GET /_search
{
  "query": { 			// query context
    "bool": { 
      "must": [
        { "match": { "title":   "Search"        }},
        { "match": { "content": "Elasticsearch" }}
      ],
      "filter": [ 		// filter context
        { "term":  { "status": "published" }},
        { "range": { "publish_date": { "gte": "2015-01-01" }}}
      ]
    }
  }
}

	
	Filtey context
		Filter context is mostly used for filtering structured data

	Leaf query clauses
		match text, number, date or boolean value.
		term 
		range

	Compound query clauses
Boolean

POST _search
{
  "query": {
    "bool" : {
      "must" : {
        "term" : { "user.id" : "kimchy" }
      },
      "filter": {
        "term" : { "tags" : "production" }
      },
      "must_not" : {
        "range" : {
          "age" : { "gte" : 10, "lte" : 20 }
        }
      },
      "should" : [
        { "term" : { "tags" : "env1" } },
        { "term" : { "tags" : "deployed" } }
      ],
      "minimum_should_match" : 1,
      "boost" : 1.0
    }
  }
}

Boosting
	Returns documents matching a positive query while reducing the relevance score of documents that also match a negative query.
	You can use the boosting query to demote certain documents without excluding them from the search results.

GET /_search
{
  "query": {
    "boosting": {
      "positive": {
        "term": {
          "text": "apple"
        }
      },
      "negative": {
        "term": {
          "text": "pie tart fruit crumble tree"
        }
      },
      "negative_boost": 0.5
    }
  }
}

Constant score query

Wraps a filter query and returns every matching document with a relevance score equal to the boost parameter value.

Geo queries
	Don't care


Joining queries
	1.Nested	2. has child	3. has parent	4 Parent ID


	parent-child relationships	[join field type]
		You can create parent-child relationships between documents in the same index using a join field mapping.


Term
	功能比match弱一点的字段查询	
	Returns documents that contain an exact term in a provided field.


Span queries
	low-level positional queries which provide expert control over the order and proximity of the specified terms.
	Span queries cannot be mixed with non-span queries (with the exception of the span_multi query).
	
	outer span query
		is allowed to set boost

	inner span query
		is not allowed to set boost
