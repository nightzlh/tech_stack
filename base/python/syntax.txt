scope

Assignments do not copy data 

In fact, all operations that introduce new names use the local scope: in particular, import statements and function definitions bind the module or function name in the local scope.

keywords: global or nonlocal
	The global statement can be used to indicate that particular variables live in the global scope and should be rebound there; the nonlocal statement indicates that particular variables live in an enclosing scope and should be rebound there.


Class definitions, like function definitions (def statements) must be executed before they have any effect.

When a class definition is left normally (via the end), a class object is created.
