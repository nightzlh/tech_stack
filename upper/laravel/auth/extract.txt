---- cmd about auth ----
These two commands will take care of scaffolding your entire authentication system
	php artisan make:auth
	php artisan migrate

---- auth config ----
config/auth.php

---- database Considerations ----

sure the password column is at least 60 characters in length.Maintaining the default string column length of 255 characters would be a good choice.

users (or equivalent) table contains a nullable, string  remember_token column of 100 characters. 

---- "guards" and "providers".  ----

gards:
	Guards define how users are authenticated for each request. 
providers:
	define how users are retrieved from your persistent storage. 

---- Database Considerations ----

authentication driver
	default Eloquent authentication driver: App\User Eloquent model
	database authentication driver:	which uses the Laravel query builder.

---- controller ----
pre-built authentication controllers, which are located in the  App\Http\Controllers\Auth namespace.
	RegisterController LoginController ForgotPasswordController ResetPasswordController

---- routing ----
php artisan make:auth this create changes
	app/Http/Controllers/HomeController.php
	resources/views/auth/
    resources/views/home.blade.php
    resources/views/layouts/
	in file routes/web.php
		add line Auth::routes();

	
---- redirect when authenticated ----
 You can customize the post-authentication redirect location by defining a redirectTo property on the LoginController, RegisterController, ResetPasswordController, and VerificationController:
	protected $redirectTo = '/';
 custom generation logic you may define a redirectTo method instead of a redirectTo property
protected function redirectTo()
{
    return '/path';
}
	
---- operate ----
php artsan make:auth
	Now that you have routes and views setup for the included authentication controllers, you are ready to register and authenticate new users for your application!
