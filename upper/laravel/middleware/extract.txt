---- middleware concept ----
Middleware provide a convenient mechanism for filtering HTTP requests entering your application. 

example
	Illuminate\View\Middleware\ShareErrorsFromSession middleware
	The $errors variable is bound to the view by the  Illuminate\View\Middleware\ShareErrorsFromSession middleware, which is provided by the web middleware group. When this middleware is applied an  $errors variable will always be available in your views, allowing you to conveniently assume the $errors variable is always defined and can be safely used.
