MySQL Connector/J Database URL
The following is the database connection URL syntax for MySQL Connector/J:

jdbc:mysql://[host][,failoverhost...]
    [:port]/[database]
    [?propertyName1][=propertyValue1]
    [&propertyName2][=propertyValue2]...
host:port is the host name and port number of the computer hosting your database. If not specified, the default values of host and port are 127.0.0.1 and 3306, respectively.
database is the name of the database to connect to. If not specified, a connection is made with no default database.
failover is the name of a standby database (MySQL Connector/J supports failover).
propertyName=propertyValue represents an optional, ampersand-separated list of properties. These attributes enable you to instruct MySQL Connector/J to perform various tasks.
See MySQL Reference Manual for more information.
