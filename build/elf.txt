 link editor ?

charpter 1:	file struct

object file:
	relocatable file 
		holds code and data suitable for linking with other object files to create an 
	executable or a shared object file

	executable file 
		holds a program suitable for execution

	shared object file 
		holds code and data suitable for linking in two contexts. First, the link 
	editor may process it with other relocatable and shared object files to create another object file. 
	Second, the dynamic linker combines it with an executable file and other shared objects to 
	create a process image.

ELF header
	describing the file's organization. Sections hold the bulk of object file information for the linking view: instructions, 
data, symbol table, relocation information, and so on.

program header table
	if present, tells the system how to create a process image.

section header table
	 contains information describing the file's sections. 

section 
	has an entry in the table; each entry gives information such as the section name, 
the section size, and so on. Files used during linking must have a section header table; other 
object files may or may not have one.
