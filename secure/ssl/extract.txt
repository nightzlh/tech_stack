certificate signing request
	The public key, along with the domain name(s) to be protected and (for OV and EV certificates) organizational information about the company requesting the certificate, is used to generate a certificate signing request (CSR).
	The CA validates the information in the CSR and generates a signed certificate that can be installed on the requesterâ€™s web server.

SSL/TLS works by binding the identities of entities such as websites and companies to cryptographic key pairs via digital documents known as X.509 certificates. Each key pair consists of a private key and a public key. The private key is kept secure, and the public key can be widely distributed via a certificate.



SSL certificate
	An SSL certificate (also known as a TLS or SSL/TLS certificate) is a digital document that binds the identity of a website to a cryptographic key pair consisting of a public key and a private key. The public key, included in the certificate, allows a web browser to initiate an encrypted communication session with a web server via the TLS and HTTPS protocols. The private key is kept secure on the server, and is used to digitally sign web pages and other documents (such as images and JavaScript files).
