FORMATS
	This is a string which controls the output format of the command.Format variables are enclosed in ‘#{’ and ‘}’, for example ‘#{session_name}’
	Conditionals can be nested arbitrarily. 
	format variable escape:  
		Some variables have a shorter alias such as ‘#S’; ‘##’ is replaced by a single ‘#’, ‘#,’ by a ‘,’ and ‘#}’ by a ‘}’.
	condition:
		prefixing with ‘?’ and separating two alternatives with a comma;
		example:
			if the specified variable exists and is not zero, the first alternative is chosen, otherwise the second is used.  
			For example ‘#{?session_attached,attached,not attached}’ will include the string ‘attached’
	
	regular expression comparision:
		first argument: is the pattern
		second argument: the string to compare	
		third argument (optional):  ‘r’ means the pattern is a regular expression instead of the default fnmatch(3) pattern, and ‘i’ means to ignore case.
		example:
			‘#{m:*foo*,#{host}}’ or ‘#{m/ri:^A,MYVAR}’. 
		C/: used for index output
			A ‘C’ performs a search for an fnmatch(3) pattern or regular expression in the pane content and evaluates to zero if not found, or a line number if found.	
		example:
			‘#{C/r:^Start}’
